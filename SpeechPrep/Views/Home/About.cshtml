            Speech Prep is an Automated Interview Assistant (IAI) that will ask you behavioral questions commonly asked during interviews.

            Speech Prep was born of a desire to better our interviewing skills as we began rehearsing for our upcoming interviews in the tech industry. 
            While many questions are answerable for any field you are interested in, you may see a few that are especially pertinent to those of us in the field of technology. 
            As we expand this service, it will become both more generalized in its question asking, but also more specific in the types of questions asked.
