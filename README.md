# Speech Prep

This Automated Interview Assistant **(IAI)** will work with you to on behavioral questions commonly asked during interviews.

## Phase 1

### Create **Speech Prep** Web App

1. Accept user registrations
2. Create a basic user profile
3. Allow user to see **thumb up** *(user feels they have mastery of the question)* and **thumb down** *(user wants to keep working on (increase frequency asked)) questions.
4. Application will show question then will ask the question audibly (press spacebar to start timer).
5. Application will time the question answered (press spacebar to stop timer)
6. User will be asked to rate their performance on their answer.

## Phase 2

### Get your camera working for you

Integrate camera tracking (eye contact) to the application.
App will (*optionally*) provide tips for posture, eye contact with camera, background noise (audible and visual)

## Phase 3

### Let's make this Social

Create an environment where users can post their answers to questions, and receive feedback from the community.
Answers may be written, or audio or video recorded.
