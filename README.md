# Speech Prep

Speech Prep is an Automated Interview Assistant **(IAI)** that will ask you behavioral questions commonly asked during interviews.

Speech Prep was born of a desire to better our interviewing skills as we began rehearsing for our upcoming interviews in the tech industry. 
While many questions are answerable for any field you are interested in, you may see a few that are especially pertinent to those of us in the 
field of technology. As we expand this service, it will become both more generalized in its question asking, but also more specific in the types
of questions asked. 

Speech Prep is being developed in three phases:

## Phase 1

### Create **Speech Prep** Web App

1. Accept user registrations
2. Create a basic user profile
3. Allow user to see **thumb up** *(user feels they have mastery of the question)* and **thumb down** *(user wants to keep working on (increase frequency asked)) questions.
4. Application will show question then will ask the question audibly (press spacebar to start timer).
5. Application will time the question answered (press spacebar to stop timer)
6. User will be asked to rate their performance on their answer.

## Phase 2

### Get your camera working for you

Integrate camera tracking (eye contact) to the application.
App will (*optionally*) provide tips for posture, eye contact with camera, background noise (audible and visual)

## Phase 3

### Let's make this Social

Create an environment where users can post their answers to questions, and receive feedback from the community.
Answers may be written, or audio or video recorded.
